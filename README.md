## 8. Backlog
- When modifying the text overlfow, the rest of the text outside the content box won't be shown. It is practical for a brief description of the task only.
- When the task is checked as done, the number of tasks status still remains the same unless it was deleted. 

## P.S. :
- Most part of this project, I did it mainly follow through the "Modern React with Redux [2023 Update]" course of Udemy; in section 6, to be specific.
- For some additional parts like counting the tasks and hiding the editing button when editing the task, I ask my friends for their guidances.
